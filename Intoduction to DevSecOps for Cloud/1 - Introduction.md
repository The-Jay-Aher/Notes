# 1 - Introduction

## Course Goal

Apply DevSecOps methodology to secure software development, deployment, and operations in cloud environments.

## Prerequisites

- Cloud computing fundamentals
- Basic software development lifecycle (SDLC) understanding
- Familiarity with CI/CD concepts

## What DevSecOps Means

DevSecOps integrates security into every phase of software delivery rather than treating security as a final gate.

Core mindset:

- Build secure by default
- Automate security checks
- Continuously monitor and improve

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this track, you should be able to:

1. Explain DevSecOps lifecycle stages.
2. Identify security controls across planning, coding, testing, release, deployment, and monitoring.
3. Select cloud-native services/tools to improve software security posture.
