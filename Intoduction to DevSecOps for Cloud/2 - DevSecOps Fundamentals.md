# 2 - DevSecOps Fundamentals

## Software Security in SDLC

Secure software development applies security controls throughout SDLC stages:

1. Plan
2. Design
3. Develop
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Operate and maintain

## NIST SSDF (Secure Software Development Framework)

NIST SSDF provides secure development practices focused on:

- Preparing the organization
- Protecting software
- Producing well-secured software
- Responding to vulnerabilities

## Application Security (AppSec)

AppSec focuses on securing software by:

- Identifying vulnerabilities early
- Implementing preventive and detective controls
- Validating remediation continuously

## Security Teaming Concepts

- **Blue Team:** Defensive monitoring and protection.
- **Red Team:** Offensive simulation/attack perspective.
- **Purple Team:** Collaborative feedback loop between red and blue teams.

## DevOps vs DevSecOps

### DevOps

- Focuses on speed, collaboration, and automation between development and operations.

### DevSecOps

- Extends DevOps by integrating security controls and validation earlier (shift-left) and continuously.

## Cloud Security Foundations

- Shared responsibility model
- IAM and least privilege
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Defense in depth

## CI/CD and DevSecOps Lifecycle

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Frequent code integration with automated build/test checks.

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

- Delivery: code is always releasable.
- Deployment: code changes are automatically pushed to production when approved.

### DevSecOps Lifecycle Stages

1. Plan
2. Code
3. Build
4. Test
5. Release
6. Deploy
7. Monitor
8. Respond

## Quick Summary

1. DevSecOps embeds security into every software lifecycle stage.
2. Automation and shift-left reduce risk and remediation cost.
3. Cloud-native security controls are essential for modern delivery pipelines.
