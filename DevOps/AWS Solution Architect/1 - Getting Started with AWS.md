# Regions and Availability Zone
## How to choose a region?

**Compliance** - with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves the region without you explicit permission
**Proximity** - to customers: reduced latency
**Available Services** - within a region: new services and features are not available in all the regions
**Pricing** - Pricing varies from region to region

### AWS Availability Zone

Each region has many availability zones
(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)

Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centre with redundant power, networking, and connectivity

They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters

They're connected with high bandwidth and ultra-low latency networking
