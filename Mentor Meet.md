    Doubts
    Is there a single EFS for the entire VPC or a single EFS for the private/public subnet? 1.
    What is the virtual tape used for, like EBS is used for an EC2 Instance and EFS for multiple
    EC2 instances?
2.  What is default tenancy? 3.
    When should I attempt the cloud practitioner exam? 4.
    Cloud shell not working: 'Timed out while opening the session' This error was there for one

    (RDS, Dynamo DB)
    Understand the Disaster Recovery mechanism and how it works
    Understand Web-Application Firewall

    CertyIQ - 7-8 times 25, 5–6 times then 50, as much as you can try then 100
17. Do after exam
    Design a 3-tier application using AWS, and it should be (cost-optimized, ec2-instance, load
    balancing, auto-scaling groups, s3, vpc, database), using terraform in the best way, and what
    all components will be used, try to host a static website inside, what all different elements
    can be used in a 3-tier web application, the application should be highly scalable, create a
    disaster recovery mechanism
18. Create an estimate according to the 3-tier application ( https://calculator.aws/#/addService)
